# Sample App to test Keyboard Switching

This sample app allows to select and switch keyboards.

**NOTE:** On Linux typing in Winforms fields with a selected Keyman keyboard works only if
a version of libgdiplus is used that has the Pango rendering enabled, e.g. by installing and
using `mono5-sil` and related packages.
